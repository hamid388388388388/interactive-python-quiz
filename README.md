# Interactive Python Quiz Game

This is a simple quiz game built using Python and Tkinter.  
The idea behind this project was to create a small but complete application where a user can answer questions through a graphical interface instead of the command line.

The game shows one question at a time with four options. When the user selects an answer, the program checks it and updates the score. If the answer is wrong, the game ends. If all questions are answered correctly, the final score is shown.

## Why I Made This
I built this project to practice Python logic and basic GUI development. It helped me understand how user interaction works in a desktop application and how different parts of a program connect together.

## Features
- Simple and clean graphical interface
- Multiple-choice questions
- Score tracking
- Instant feedback on answers
- Easy to run and understand

## Technologies Used
